# Product of Other Numbers

You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a function get_all_products() that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.

For example, given:

```python
[1, 7, 3, 4]

# the function would return

[84, 12, 28, 21]

# by calculating

[7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]
```

Do not use division in the solution

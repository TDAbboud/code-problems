# Search in Sorted Array

Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of
times, write a function to find an element in the array. You may assume that the
array was originally sorted in increasing order

Example: Find the index of 5 in the following array

```python

 arr = [15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14]
 print search_in_sorted_array(arr, 5)    # 8 (index of 5 in the array)
```

# Queue Two Stacks

Implement a queue with 2 stacks. Your queue should have an enqueue and a
dequeue function and it should be "first in first out" (FIFO).
Optimize for the time cost of m function calls on your queue. These can be any
mix of enqueue and dequeue calls.

Assume you already have a stack implementation and it gives O(1) time push
and pop.

# Bracket Validator

Write a braces/brackets/parenthesis validator.
Let's say:

'(', '{', '[' are called "openers."
')', '}', ']' are called "closers."
Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an input string's
openers and closers are properly nested.

Examples:

"{ [ ] ( ) }" should return True
"{ [ ( ] ) }" should return False
"{ [ }" should return False"]}]}"})'

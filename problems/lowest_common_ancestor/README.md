# Lowest Common Ancestor

Given two nodes in a binary tree (NOT a BST) write a function to find the lowest common ancestor among
the two nodes. Assume that both nodes exist in the tree

For Example:
```python

 #        1
 #     2     3
 #   4  5   6  7
 #  8
 # 9

    print lowest_common_ancestor(root, 8, 5)  # 2
    print lowest_common_ancestor(root, 7, 9)  # 1

```
